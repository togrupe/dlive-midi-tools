# dlive-midi-tools
## Description
Python and MIDI/TCP-based tool to prepare channel lists for Allen &amp; Heath dLive & Avantis consoles. 
Based on a spreadsheet the following parameters can be preconfigured and in very few steps be written to real 
dLive/Avantis systems or to dLive/Avantis Director via MIDI/TCP or CSV import. Additionally, from the same spreadsheet 
or the current console settings a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) recording session for Reaper or Tracks Live can be generated. 
- Name & Color for: 
  - Channel
  - DCA
  - Aux
  - Group
  - Matrices
  - FX Sends
  - FX Returns
- Channel Mute
- Fader Level
- Main Mix Assignments
- DCA Assignments
- 48V Phantom Power (Local, DX1 & DX3, SLink) 
- PAD (Local, DX1 & DX3, SLink)
- Gain (Local, DX1 & DX3, SLink)
- Mute Group Assignments (dLive only)
- HPF On (dLive only)
- HPF Value (dLive only)
- Source & Socket Patching (via dLive Director CSV Import)

## Input file / The Spreadsheet Template
Example spreadsheet files for dLive: **dLiveChannelList.xlsx** and Avantis: **AvantisChannelList.xlsx** can be found in the root folder. 
By default, channels 1-128 (dLive) and 1-64 (Avantis) are available in the sheets. If you need less, 
just delete the channels you don't want to process. <br>

You can also write in blocks. e.g. 
* CH1-16
* CH25-32
* CH97-128

in this case, the channels not mentioned are not affected, this works as well for the  `Groups`.

Empty lines in between are **not** supported. <br>

Microsoft Excel and LibreOffice Calc Spreadsheet can be used to write/save the sheets.
Please make sure that you save your changes in the (*.xlsx or *.ods) format.

> **_NOTE:_**  You can add additional columns, like 'Mic Stand', 'Mic/DI', 'Sub-core Patching' etc., but please make sure that the first line keeps the existing fields including their names, otherwise the data canÂ´t be parsed properly. If you want, you can also reorder the columns to your needs.

![TracksliveOpenTemplate](doc/trackslive/trackslive_open_template.png)

Click on `Open Template` and select the generated file.


## Settings on the console
The `Midi Channel` setting on dLive under `Utils/Shows -> Control -> Midi` should be set to: `12 to 16`, which is default.

If you want to change the preconfigured Midi port, you can change it in the Graphical User Interface according to your dLive settings. 

## Default IP-Address
The default dLive Mixrack IP-Address is: 192.168.1.70. This IP-Address is preconfigured in the scripts. If you want to 
change it, you can edit the field `ip` in the file: dliveConstants.py or during runtime within the Graphical User Interface.  

Please make sure that your Ethernet or Wi-Fi interface has an IP-Address in the same subnet. e.g. IP: 192.168.1.10 / Subnet: 255.255.255.0
 

## Usage
Prerequisites: 
* Windows >= 10 / macOS >= Monterey
* dLive Firmware: 1.9x / 2.x
* dLive Director: 1.9x / 2.x (Optional)
* Avantis Firmware: 1.30
* Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc Spreadsheet
* Reaper (Optional)
* Tracks Live v1.3 (Optional)
* Python 3.12 (Optional, if you want to build the software yourself)

To run the tool, you have two options:<br><br>
A: Use an available download (see above), unzip it, start the dmt tool and continue with Step 4 <br> If the tool does not start automatically: Try it with "Open with -> Terminal" or run it from terminal.<br><br>
    
   If you see the following message: ![Overview](doc/message.png) <br><br>
   Please go to System Preferences -> Privacy and Security -> Security -> Open Anyway ![Overview](doc/preferences_privacy.png)<br><br>
   Enter your Password and click ![Overview](doc/open-anyway.png)
   Continue with Step 4.
    
B: Build it your own from scratch, using the following steps.<br>

B1. Before you run the script, please run the following command to download the required Python modules using `pip`. Please make sure `pip` is installed.

`pip install -r dependencies.txt`

B2. Run the script with the following command: 

`cd src` <br>
`python3 Main.py`

B3. (Optional) If you want to make a binary out of it, please do the following: 

    B3.1 Installation of pyinstaller

    `pip install pyinstaller`

    B3.2 Create a onefile binary (works for Windows and macOS)

    `pyinstaller -y --onefile -w ./src/Main.py`


4. Afterwards, the following window appears. This can take a couple of seconds.

![Gui](doc/gui.png)

__Recommendation__: Please back up your current show file, just to be on the safe side if something goes wrong.


1. Select the console: `dLive` or `Avantis`

2. Check the (Mixrack-) IP and Midi Port. 

3. `Save` Persists the current settings (console, IP, midi-port) for the next start of the tool.

4. `Director`, sets the IP to 127.0.0.1, to use Director locally on the same machine. Director has to be started before. You can also write to a Director instance running on a different machine, in this case, please use the external IP-Address of this machine where Director is already started and running. (In case of connection issues, please check the firewall rules or disable it temporarily)

5. `Default` Sets the IP back to default: 192.168.1.70.

6. `Test Connection` Tries to establish a test connection to the console. In both cases (successful/failed) you will be informed by a pop-up.

The tool has currently the following modes:
* Spreadsheet to Console / DAW (Continue with next Step) - Reads from a spreadsheet into console or to a DAW Session.
* Console to DAW (Continue with Step 10) - Reads from the console and writes a DAW session.

Choose which mode you want to use:

<img alt="tabs" src="doc/tabs.png" width="300"/>

7. Select the spreadsheet columns you want to write and then select `Write to Audio Console or Director`.
   
   `Select All` selects all checkboxes.
   `Clear` removes all ticks.

8. If you also want to create a DAW Session template (Reaper or Tracks Live), set the corresponding tick. The session files `<input-spreadsheet-file>-reaper-recording-template.rpp` / `<input-spreadsheet-file>-trackslive-recording.template` 
   will be generated into the directory from where the spreadsheet has been chosen. In the `Channels` tab, you can configure which channel shall be recorded and "record armed". The patching is 1:1 (derived from the channel number) <br><br>
   
   The following DAW-based options are available: <br>
   * Disable Track Numbering <br>
   * Disable Track Coloring <br>
   * An additional custom track prefix can also be added.<br>
   * Add two additional mono busses to record your mixing sum.

<br><br>
> **_NOTE:_**  You can also use the tool to create only the DAW session file (Reaper or Tracks Live), in case you use a different audio console. In this case, disable the checkbox "Write to Audio Console or Director", choose your DAW and continue with Step 10.<br><br>


9. `Generate Director CSV (Columns: Name, Color, Source, Socket, Gain, Pad, Phantom)` Generates a CSV file for Director incl. Name, Color, Patching, Gain, Pad, Phantom, using the Director CSV Import function, you can use this as a baseline for the MIDI based parameters. 

<img alt="director-main-system" src="doc/directorcsv/director-main-system.png" width="150"/>

<img alt="director-import-export" src="doc/directorcsv/director-import-export.png" width="300"/>

> **_NOTE:_** This feature uses the columns Name, Color, Source, Socket, Gain, Pad, Phantom from the `Channels` Tab. 



10. Click the button `Open spreadsheet and start writing process` to select the spreadsheet. Afterwards, the selected action(s) start automatically.
   
   **Recommendation:** Please test it first with the delivered spreadsheet to make sure everything works properly.

11. Console to DAW - Generates a DAW session from the current console settings. This can be triggered even later, when an existing show is available on the console. This process doesnÂ´t need a spreadsheet. 

<img alt="consoletodaw" src="doc/console-to-daw.png" width="600"/>

Options:
   * Choose `Start` and `End` channel to be used for DAW generation.
   * Disable Track Numbering <br>
   * Disable Track Coloring <br>
   * An additional custom track prefix can also be added.<br>
   * Add two additional mono busses to record your mixing sum.

Click `Generate DAW session(s) from current console settings`

12. If something goes wrong, please check the Python console or the `main.log`

If you find any issues, please let me know. New ideas are welcome. 

Have fun!
