         See http://www.opensource.org/licenses/Python-2.0 for full terms
Note: backport changes by Raymond were originally distributed under MIT
      license, but since the original license for Python is more
      restrictive than MIT, code cannot be released under its terms and
      still adheres to the limitations of Python license.
